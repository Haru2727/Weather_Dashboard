# Weather_Dashboard
# Server side API homework 6 

As a developer we are often tasked with retrieving data from another applications's API and using it in your own app.  Making request using parameters to a URL allow a developer to acces the data.  This week we are tasked to make a weahter dashboard that will run in the browser and feature an dynamically updated HTML.

# User Story 

AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

# Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
WHEN I open the weather dashboard
THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast

# What I Learned 

With having the project start this week the homework was a stressful hurdle to tackle.  using Google I found multiple working versions of this application and used it as a guideline to get this accomplished.  I used ajax to obtain information from the OpenWather API, I found most of the information using this method, but could not acces the UV Index.  I am still trying to get it and know where it is located but for some reason when I access it the value is not under the lat and lon like in the given example on OpenWeather API.
